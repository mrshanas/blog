I'm a software developer currently taking my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at University of Dar es Salaam, Apart from nerdy and techy stuffs I love movies alot "_Purely MCU fan_", playing video games especially FPS, listening to music, fantasizing and blogging

> My programming journey started in 2021 after finishing my high school studies, I had nothing to do ðŸ˜… for the mean time while I was waiting for my results, so I decided taking my old Dad's PC running on Windows XP and wrote some HTML code that I recall learning during my secondary school studies and thats where the fun started ðŸ˜„
