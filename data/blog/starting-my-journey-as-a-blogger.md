Since I started programming I've learnt alot from google, tutorials, courses, from others and blog articles but sometimes its hard to find what you need exactly and when you find it you easily forget to document it for future cases, that is what I did mostly but as I progress I saw the advantages of documenting what you learn as you help others and it helps to improve myself

I'll be sharing the knowledge that I get from others and I learn in this site and also in my [Dev.to](https://dev.to/mrshanas) account

_Stay tuned for more of my posts_
